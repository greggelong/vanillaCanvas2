# vanillaCanvas2


playing with the 2d vanilla js canvas api

following a great tutorial

https://youtu.be/dQKYao-daYw

but not following it exactly

really impressed by canvas shadow effect so coool

looks great I have not seen anything like it in p5


using the mouse event listener to call a recursive function

sure makes for a lot of processing. the fan can be like the wind
